Hello! My name is Kathleen Hill. I am fascinated by strategic communications, the umbrella of **digital marketing**, **multimedia** **storytelling**, **online journalism**, **photography** and **social media**.  After four years of honing my writing, editing, design and photography  skills, I graduated from Indiana University-Bloomington with a Bachelors  of Arts in Journalism.

My hobbies include reading, writing, traveling, taking pictures and  attempting to crochet. I also love cooking, scrapbooking and all things  Disney.

Speaking of Disney, Iâ€™m currently working as a Marketing Strategy Associate Manager supporting Disney Sports. I love being a part of the  Disney Cast Member family. I admire Walt Disney for his unique ability  to tell timeless stories that engage generations of audiences.

I want to pursue a career that challenges me to grow as a storyteller, photographer, writer and leader.
